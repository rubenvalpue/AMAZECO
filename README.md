**AMAZECO: Covering the Amazon with an Ecosystem Structure EBV product combining satellite and airborne lidar.**

Amazeco aims to provide maps of structural Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), derived from lidar remote sensing. The project wants to support research and decision-making on the conservation, restoration and management of tropical forest ecosystems.

Authors: Danilo Roberti Alves de Almeida, Carlos Alberto Silva, Eric Bastos Gorgens, Mauro de Assis, Michael Keller, Jean Ometto and Ruben Valbuena.

# Team

Amazeco members are specialists in the use of lidar data in Brazilian Amazon. Ruben Valbuena is the principal investigator of the Amazeco. He has highlighted the need for standardized morphological traits to support public policy and decision-making (Valbuena et al. 2020). Eric Gorgens recently published a paper about the giant trees of the Amazon using lidar (Gorgens et al. 2021). Carlos Silva is expert on GEDI data (Silva et al. 2021) and he is the developer of important lidar R packages (e.g., “ForestGapR” and “Treetop”), including the rGEDI (Silva et al. 2020). Danilo Almeida worked with Brazilian Amazon lidar data during his Masters and Ph.D. studies, and has experience in leaf area density modeling (developer of the R package “leafR”). Mauro Assis has extensive experience with lidar data processing and cloud computing. He has been working with Jean Ometo, coordinator of the EBA project, the largest lidar database in the Brazilian Amazon. Michael Keller is the coordinator of the Sustainable Landscape project, the first and largest multitemporal data collection in the Brazilian Amazon.
